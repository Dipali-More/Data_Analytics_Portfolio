# [Project 1: Home Depot Sales KPI using Tableau Dashboard](https://github.com/deepali-more/Tableau-Projects.git)
In this project, I explored various tools of Tableau to create a dashboard for retail sales data
* Data is taken from the internal database
* Key Performance Indicators fixed and drawn using calculated field in Tableau
* Final Dashboard is published on Tableau Public
* Interactive [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/HOMEDEPOTSALESDASHBOARD/SALESDASHBOARD#1) live on my Tableau Public profile.
